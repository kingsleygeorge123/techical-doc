            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>WordPress (WP, WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores. WordPress is used by more than 60 million websites, including 33.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2019, WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions in use. WordPress has also been used for other application domains such as pervasive display systems (PDS).</p>
            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>"WordPress is a factory that makes webpages"[14] is a core analogy designed to clarify the functions of WordPress: it stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.
                WordPress has a web template system using a template processor. Its architecture is a front controller, routing all requests for non-static URIs to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable permalinks
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Themes</strong><br>
                        WordPress users may install and switch among different themes. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. </li>
                        <li><strong>Plugins</strong><br>
                            WordPress' plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile applications</strong><br>

The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other features</strong><br>
                            WordPress also features integrated link management; a search engine–friendly, clean permalink structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for tagging of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to smart quotes). </li>

            <h2 id="setting_up_a_website_or_blog">Setting up a Website or Blog</h2>
            <p>Whether you are wanting to learn how to create a blog or setting up a website for the first time, the first steps are always the same but before you can begin, you have to decide how you want to set it up. Most people choose to use either a website builder or content management system (CMS) like WordPress as those are the easiest if you have never started a website before. However, for the more advanced option, you could build a site from scratch, but that requires coding skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1: Buy a Domain Name</strong><br>
                    If you don’t already have a domain name for your new website or blog then the hardest part is picking a domain name that best suits your business or blog. Once you have decided on a domain name and it’s available for purchase, the next step to buy it!</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: Choosing a Web Host</strong><br>
                    There are many hosting companies out there, but for a WordPress site, Bluehost should definitely be at the top of anyone’s list. Bluehost is recommended by WordPress for website hosting and has been for more than 10 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Up Your Hosting Account</strong><br>

                    To get started, go to Bluehost’s home page and click “Get Started.”
                    
                    Next, you need to choose a domain name for your site. If you already own a domain name, you can enter it here, and you will just have to go through a few extra steps to make sure you get your DNS pointed to Bluehost. If you don’t already have a domain name, you can purchase one from right in the sign up process, and the best part is, it comes free with your new managed WordPress hosting account purchase.</li>
            
            </ul>
            <h2 id="multi-user_and_multi-blogging">Multi-user and multi-blogging</h2>
            <p>Prior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.</p>
            <h2 id="classic_editor_plugin">Classic Editor plugin</h2>
            <p>The Classic Editor Plugin was created as result of User preferences and as a way to help website developers to maintain past plugins only compatible with WordPress 4.9.8 giving plugin developers time to get their plugins updated & compatible with the 5.0 release. Having the Classic Editor plugin installed restores the "classic" editing experience that WordPress has had up until the WordPress 5.0 release. The Classic Editor Plugin will be supported at least until 2022.
                The Classic Editor plugin is active on over 5,000,000 installations of WordPress
                </p>
            <h2 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>Many security issues have been uncovered in the software, particularly in 2007, 2008, and 2015. According to Secunia, WordPress in April 2009 had seven unpatched security advisories (out of 32 total), with a maximum rating of "Less Critical". Secunia maintains an up-to-date list of WordPress vulnerabilities.
                In January 2007, many high-profile search engine optimization (SEO) blogs, as well as many low-profile commercial blogs featuring AdSense, were targeted and attacked with a WordPress exploit.A separate vulnerability on one of the project site's web servers allowed an attacker to introduce exploitable code in the form of a back door to some downloads of WordPress 2.1.1. The 2.1.2 release addressed this issue; an advisory released at the time advised all users to upgrade immediately.

            <h2 id="development_and_support">Development and support</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key developers</strong><br>
                    Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little were co-founders of the project. The core lead developers include Helen Hou-Sandí, Dion Hulse, Mark Jaquith, Matt Mullenweg, Andrew Ozz, and Andrew Nacin.
                    WordPress is also developed by its community, including WP testers, a group of volunteers who test each release. They have early access to nightly builds, beta versions and release candidates. Errors are documented in a special mailing list or the project's Trac tool.
                    </li>
                <li><strong>WordCamp developer and user conferences</strong><br>
                    WordCamps are casual, locally organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. The first such event was WordCamp 2006 in August 2006 in San Francisco, which lasted one day and had over 500 attendees. The first WordCamp outside San Francisco was held in Beijing in September 2007. Since then, there have been over 1,022 WordCamps in over 75 cities in 65 different countries around the world.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Support</strong><br>
                    WordPress' primary support website is WordPress.org. This support website hosts both WordPress Codex, the online manual for WordPress and a living repository for WordPress information and documentation, and WordPress Forums, an active online community of WordPress users.
